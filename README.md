# 🥤 grew

> *A lean, mean, package-managing machine. In Go.*

[![Go Version][go-badge]][go-url]

`grew` is what happens when you look at your package manager and think: *"This could be so much simpler."* Deterministic installs. Clean symlinks. A doctor that actually tells you what's wrong. No drama.

> 💬 **A word from the author:**
> *I've been a die-hard Homebrew user for longer than I care to admit. brew and I? We go way back. Late nights, broken PATH, the works — and I loved every minute of it. I love brew so much, in fact, that I thought: "What if I just… made it better?" Audacious? Absolutely. Foolish? Possibly. Fun? You bet. grew is my love letter to brew — written in Go, with a cheeky grin.*

## ✨ What it does

- 📦 **Formula + cask installs** with SHA256 verification (no funny business)
- 🔒 **Sandboxed source builds** using macOS Seatbelt or Linux namespaces to keep your system safe
- 🔐 **Sandboxed post-install scripts** — keg is read-only, network denied, minimal env (Homebrew runs these unsandboxed)
- ✍️ **Ed25519 bottle signing** — cryptographic signatures on downloads, verified against a local trust store
- 🏷️ **Signed tap verification** — refuse or warn on unsigned git commits in tap repos (`HOMEGREW_TAP_VERIFY`)
- 📋 **Install snapshots** — per-file SHA256 manifests recorded at install time for integrity verification
- 📌 **Lockfile** — pin exact versions, hashes, and dependency trees for reproducible environments
- 🔗 **Deterministic linking** with opt symlinks and dry-run support (look before you link)
- 🌳 **Dependency resolver** with an optional tree view (for the visually inclined)
- 🩺 **Doctor** that checks perms, HTTPS, broken links, snapshot integrity, and stale kegs
- 🐚 **Alias + shellenv helpers** so your workflows stay snappy

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.26+, `git`, `curl`, and a dream.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/homegrew/grew.git
cd grew
go build -o grew .
./grew help
```

That's it. No dark rituals. No 47-step setup guide.

---

## 📖 Usage

```bash
./grew install jq              # the classic
./grew install -s ldns         # build from source, like a purist
./grew install --cask firefox  # going big
./grew link jq                 # stitch it in
./grew deps --tree jq          # what hath jq wrought
./grew upgrade                 # stay fresh
./grew cleanup -n              # peek before you sweep
./grew verify jq               # check installed files against manifest
./grew lock                    # pin your environment
./grew audit --strict          # lint your formulas
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

grew keeps its stuff tidy under one roof. Tweak it with env vars:

| Variable | Default | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `HOMEGREW_PREFIX` | `~/.grew` | The kingdom |
| `HOMEGREW_APPDIR` | `~/Applications` | Where casks live |
| `HOMEGREW_TAP_VERIFY` | `off` | Tap commit signature policy (`off`, `warn`, `strict`) |
| `HOMEGREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API` | *(unset)* | Force git clone instead of API tarball for taps |

Everything else flows from the prefix:

```
~/.grew/
├── Cellar/        ← installed packages (each keg has a .MANIFEST.json)
├── Taps/          ← formula definitions (git-cloned or API-fetched)
├── bin/           ← symlinked binaries
├── etc/           ← trusted-keys (Ed25519 public keys, one per line)
├── tmp/           ← ephemeral stuff
└── grew.lock      ← lockfile (opt-in, created by `grew lock`)
```

**Shell setup** (pick your flavour):

```bash
# bash / zsh
eval "$(./grew shellenv)"

# fish
./grew shellenv fish | source
```

---

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
make check         # go test -v -race ./...
make build         # go generate + go build
make lint          # golangci-lint (if installed)
```

**Project layout:**

```
grew/
├── internal/
│   ├── cmd/          ← CLI commands (the face)
│   ├── cellar/       ← installed package management
│   ├── formula/      ← formula parsing and validation
│   ├── cask/         ← cask parsing and Caskroom

│   ├── sandbox/      ← build + post-install sandboxing (macOS/Linux)
│   ├── signing/      ← Ed25519 bottle signing + trust store

│   ├── lockfile/     ← reproducible environment pinning
│   ├── service/      ← background service management (launchd/systemd)

## 🔐 Security Model

grew is designed to be more secure than Homebrew out of the box:

| Feature | grew | Homebrew |
|---|---|---|
| **Bottle signing** | Ed25519 signatures verified against local trust store | None — relies on HTTPS + SHA256 only |
| **Tap verification** | Optional GPG/SSH commit signature enforcement | None |
| **Post-install sandbox** | Read-only keg, no network, minimal env | Unsandboxed |
| **Source build sandbox** | macOS Seatbelt / Linux bwrap+unshare, no network | macOS Seatbelt only, no Linux |
| **Install manifests** | Per-file SHA256 snapshot at install time | None |
| **Lockfile** | Full dependency tree with hashes | None |
| **Integrity check** | `grew verify` + `grew doctor` snapshot check | None |
| **HTTPS enforcement** | At parse time — HTTP URLs rejected before download | At download time |

**Gradual rollout:** signature verification doesn't block installs until you add keys to `etc/trusted-keys`. Tap verification is opt-in via `HOMEGREW_TAP_VERIFY`. This lets you adopt security features incrementally.
